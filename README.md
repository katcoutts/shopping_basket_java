Coding Challenge - Shopping Basket Task

You have been asked to model a shopping basket.

We must be able to:

Add items to the shopping basket
Remove items from the shopping basket
Empty the shopping basket
Additionally, we must be able to calculate the total value of the shopping basket accounting for:

Buy-one-get-one-free discounts on items
10% off on totals greater than Â£20 (after bogof)
2% off on total (after all other discounts) for customers with loyalty cards.
We must be able to see the code running via passing tests or Terminal output.

What we will be looking for:
Evidence of using a statically typed programming language and solid coding techniques with evidence of test driven development.

NOTES:
Shopping basket is a class with an array of shopping items.
Some shopping items are bogofable (could be interface or each item could have a bogof value of true or false).
Items have a name and price. If you get two of an item which is BOGOF you only pay for one. Maybe get a note in case you take only one item of a BOGOF offer.
Factory pattern for making shopping items?
